As you walk upstairs, you notice the sudden drop in temperature. Photos of employees at various staff events line the left hand side walls of the corridor leading to the managers office. They look amateur and some are nearly impossible to make out, but everyone is smiling and having a great time. You approach the door to Chris' office, what do you want to do?
*choice
	#Follow the manager into his office.
		*label manager
		The manager opens the door and suddenly a sweet smell envelops your senses which remind you of happy childhood memories. The room itself however, looks nothing like the rest of the office. In fact it looks unfinished and a bit barron. To avoid potentially insulting Chris you hide your true feelings and say:
		*choice
			#What a lovely office you have.
				Chris replies: "Heh, you honestly don't have to say that ${name}, I am fully aware this looks like a basement. It's on the to-do list, the other rooms such as the main office needed finishing first".
				*choice
					#It does look a little depressing in here, why did you make this your office?
						"Truth is I disslike being separate from the rest of the team, but nobody else fancied up here and it made sense for me to take it. I have got the interior decorator coming around next week though, everyone's going to wish they had this office by the end of it!".
						*goto business
					#How long has it been like this for?
						"Oh not long we only moved into this office one month ago, but it's really beginning to agitate me now having to work in this space. Next week an interior decorator will be around to help fix it up".
						*goto business
			#What a pleasant smell, it's really bringing back some amazing memories.
				Chris replies: "Glad you like it. It's a freshly cut grass smell... well I have to make this office pleasant in some way. As you can tell it's unfinished, but it's usually only me in here so it doesn't need to be fancy looking unlike downstairs. Don't worry though, I'm going to have an interior decorator come in and transform this into a paradise!".
				*choice
					#Say: I look forward to the finished product.
						*label business
						"Yeah hopefully soon this place will look complete! But enough of that, let's get down to business. You have arrived here to progress your development skills. Well, you're in great hands here. What is it you wish to expand in particular?".

								*label shadowing
								"Awesome! I'm highly comptetent in this area, hopefully I can show you a thing or two".

									#Say: I am already advanced in this field, I am only looking to sharpen my skills.
										"Great, well then it's probably best you shadow me for the moment".
										*choice 
											#Say: Great! Where do we begin?
												"Well let's start with you ${name}, what is it you wish to achieve with this role?".
												*choice
													#Say: To get more experience on the CV.
														"Well I guarantee you'll leave this office with a unique experience ${name}. We might be relatively small but we use that to our advantage to make it quirky".
														*choice 
															#Ask: Quirky how?
																"Well firstly we play to our employees strengths by pushing projects toward areas they're most skilled in. Secondly, we always try to have an internal project running alongside a client so everyone can expand their knowledge. Thirdly, have you ever played Vietnamese shuttlecock at work? If not then you are in for a treat as every lunch time we have activities like this to get you out of your seat. I never want a day to be the same".
																*goto startjob
															#Say: Sounds good. What projects do you currently have on?
																"We are currently working on a Magento 2 application for a client. Internally we are working on a virtual reality zombie escape room game".
																*choice
																	#Say: Zombies and problem solving sounds really intense...
																		"My thoughts exactly, the only problem is testing. We've come to a position where the game is too intense to test and it's freaking out our employees. But you ${name} I have high hopes for, the zombies could use some fresh meat!".

																			#Say: Bring it on, I'll find all the bugs!
																				"That's exactly what we're looking for!".
																				*goto future
																			#Say: I don't think so, not my game!
																				*label future

																					#Ask: Where do you see me in the future?
																						"Well hopefully with us! You seem compentent and fun and you can clearly hold a conversation with me - which is encouraging. I hope I come across the same".
																						*goto startjob
																					#Say: Good, because I have a few ideas I'd love for you to hear.
																						"Excellent ${name}, and I'd love to hear them. Your opinion really does count here, and despite only knowing you briefly I can already tell you will fit right in".
																						*goto startjob
																	#Say: Magento 2...
																		"Yes, a large client wants an eCommerce site. We are very competent in Magento 1 and have just begun expanding our knowledge into Magento 2".
																		*choice
																			#Ask: What's the difference between 1 and 2?
																				"The architecture of Magento 2 is vastly different from Magento 1 and thus requires a steep learning curve. Changing from version 1 to 2 is more of a process than an upgrade. As a result, the development has changed considerbly".
																				*choice
																					#Say: That must've annoyed the Magento community.
																						"Yes, and the marketplace is still emerging which means some features that used to exist in Magento 1 via extensions would require custom integration for Magento 2. As a result, Magento 1 might still be the best solution depending on your clients needs. Sooner or later, Magento will stop security patches for versions 1.X. The faster you can progress to Magento 2, the better".
																						*goto startjob
																					#Say: I see so really they are 2 separate beasts.
																						"There are some changes in it's design pattern. Magento was previously considered MVC, now it could be considered MVVM - where the Magento block object acts as the ViewModel. Views (phtml files) are now responsible for fetching their information from the ViewModel. There are still many similarities however, such as: XML configuration files, themes, modules etc. It really is a beast, but I love it".
																						*goto startjob
																			#Say: I'm not a fan of Magento.
																				"I must admit the change from version 1 to 2 has shaken this community, but when do you ever stop learning in this industry? The improvements are worth learning. Having said that, people in this office share your views. Firstly it's bloated. There are too many configuration files which makes more room for annoying bugs. It also makes your code less concise and more difficult to debug. Secondly, the documentation is bad and you often find yourself reverse-engineering. Thirdly, the server costs involved in hosting such a solution are considerable. However, while WooCommerce or Shopify might be decent solutions for smaller companies, larger companies would require the complexities that Magento offers. We are experts in PHP, and now more than 25% of eCommerce shops worldwide run on some version of Magento. There really isn't an alternative for us".
																				*goto startjob
													#Say: To get to know you guys.
														"I'm flattered ${name}, we will arrange a meal for you so you can get to know us a little better. Is there anything you want to know in particular?".
														*choice
															#Ask: What do you guys do for fun?
																"Lots, every lunch time I arrange an activity so it get's everyone out of their seats. I also put aside an activity budget each month for people to vote on and every once in a while I'll subsidise a work trip abroad".
																*choice
																	#Ask: Abroad sounds nice, where have you been so far?
																		"Well so far we have been to: Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia".
																		*choice
																			#Reply: Woah that's a crazy amount of continents. Why so many and so varied?
																				"I believe that travelling is the best way to gain an insight into and appreciation for other cultures. Most of the trips have been for leisure, but occasionally they have been for work and they are the best kind of team bonding exercise! We are a family now and have been through some amazing times together".
																				*goto startjob
																			#Where's the next?
																				"There are a few working opportunities in Australia worth applying for...".
																				*goto startjob
																	#Say: That's cool, what kind of activities have you done in the past?
																		"Anything from surfing to go-karting. I usually suggest something and the office will give me their opinion. I personally prefer anything involving the water. We have also arranged some great events indoors too, however".
																		*choice
																			#What kind of watersports?
																				"I love surfing but am still learning. We are looking into kite-surfing for our next adventure. Not sure the office will agree though!".
																				*goto startjob
																			#What kind of indoor events?
																				"We love hackathons, the atmosphere is great and it gives me and excuse to buy some craft ales to tick off of my list!".
																				*choice 
																					#Ask: List?
																						"I got a gift from my father-in-law, '1001 beers you must try before you die' and I have been trying to tick them off of the list ever since".

																						*goto startjob
															#Ask: What stack do you operate with?
																"Our office has worked with many stacks, but currently the favourite is a Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP) stack".
																*choice
																	#Ask: Have you ever tried NoSQL?
																		"Yes we are practicing an internal project using a MEAN stack, and it's something we have used for mobile apps. It's de-normalised nature helps improve on performance, especially when you have a portable device accessing your API from anywhere. For websites however, relational databases are still king for now. They are more widely supported, better documented and work out-of-the-box with our platforms and frameworks".
																		*goto startjob
																	#Ask: Have you ever tried Nginx?
																		"Absolutely, we are practicing an internal project using a MEAN stack. We really like how Nginx is designed to better handle a higher number of concurrent users over Apache. On the other hand Apache is more popular, widely supported, better documented and works out-of-the-box with our platforms and frameworks".
																		*goto startjob
																	#Ask: Have you ever tried Node.js?
																		"Not extensively, but we are very familiar with JavaScript including ES6. We are using a MEAN stack in an internal project of ours, however. I personally think it's fantastic for front-end developers looking to more easily expand their knowledge into the world of back-end. It is also newer than PHP, so would naturally be more efficient. We do however, have years of experience with PHP and with such a large community and deep code base we will be sticking with PHP for now".
																		*goto startjob
															#Ask: How did you get to this position Chris?
																"A good question. I went to university with a vague love for media and art. Here I was introduced to world of programming where I quickly grew to love it's ability to bring things to life. I decided to start a business with a colleague to continue creating the things I loved, unfortunately this venture didn't work out and I got a job in an agency. Luckily, I was offered positions that gave me fantastic insight across all areas of web development. After gaining 4 years of valuable experience I went travelling to experience work in other countries, and here I am today!".
																*choice
																	#Ask: Which uni did you attend?
																		"I went to the University of Bournemouth to study Interactive Media Production where I recieved a 2:1 BA Hons degree".

																	#Say: Travelling sounds a little counter-productive to me.
																		"Not at all, in my personal experience it has enabled me to further expand my knowledge by offering more opportunities. I am not limited by my location".
																		*goto startjob
																	#Ask: What happended to the business?
																		"In the beginning the business looked really promising. We acquired offices in the middle of Bournemouth and we had a few small projects with notable clients. Dry spells however, can really harm a start-up company like ours. Unfortunately most business' fail in their first year and we were no exception. Having just come out of university we had much debt, couple that with the cost of starting a business and we quickly realised we couldn't continue like this. I loved the opportunity and it taught me a lot, but I was thankful to get out and focus on the coding".

																*label ambitions
																"That's cool ${name}, in your spare time try and come up with an idea and pitch it to me. If I think the idea is something that will benefit PortChris I may take it further".
																*choice
																	#Ask: And if not?
																		"If it isn't of any interest but you still really want to take it further, then we will arrange a meeting discussing the possibility of a hackathon. This event will take place outside work hours, but I will provide food and craft ales to fuel us all. With an entire team behind it the project is much more likely to become a reality!".

																				*goto startjob
																	#Ask: How will you take it further?

															#Reply: I have always wanted to build more games, or at least gamify a project in some way.
