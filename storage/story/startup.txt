*label approach	
Okay you've seen this reception enough, come inside and meet our team. Who would you like to approach?
*choice
	#The designer
		You walk over to the designer and Lucy has introduces you both. You automatically notice the bold radiant colours on the walls and desk. You can feel the creativity oozing from every corner here. Before an awkward silence begins, what would you like to say to the designer?
		*choice
			#I love how colourful this space is.
				The designer replies: "Thank you, I love all things bright. The manager lets us decorate our space however we wish. So I just got some paint and went crazy one day. This agency encourages stuff like this."
				*choice
					#Wow, just about the only thing colourful here is that white book.
						"Well ${name}, this is the Designed by Apple in California book. It's a book full of pictures of their devices from the 1st generation right the way through to the current. 
						*choice
							#Ask: How can I get my hands on one?
								"Special order from one of their stores. I purchased it for $300 and I don't even regret the decision.
								*choice
									#Try and hold back the laughter and ask politely why they would spend so much on a book.
										The designer replies: "I love Apple. Everything they bring out I must buy". At that moment Lucy steps in and says: "Excuse me, the manager is ready to see you now".
										*finish
									#Reply: Cool that's reasonable for such a lovely book thanks for the advice!
										"No problem ${name}, glad you can leave today having learned something!". At that moment, Lucy steps in and says: "Excuse me, the manager is ready to see you now".
										*finish
							#Say: I'm not the biggest fan of Apple, their stuff is good but expensive.
								That hasn't gone down well with the designer. The designer replies: "I see, well everything computer related"
					#Would the manager let you write rude words on the wall if he wanted?
						"Well obviously not! There is a line between slack and lenience. When needed, we all knuckle down and get on with the tasks at hand."
						*finish
					#That's a nice thing for the manager to do, he must be a cool guy.
						"Well we think so, but we're biased I suppose being an employee, I think it's because he knows how to mix a hard working environment with a fun one".
						*choice
							#Ask: What kind of fun do you get up to?
								"Loads, the manager likes to travel so regularly takes us on the most bizarre work holidays."
							#Ask: How hard does he work you?
								"Completely depends on the deadline, if there has been some slack"
			#Comment on the lovely clothing they are wearing.
				The designer replies: "Thanks ${name}! This is actually cheap knock-off item of clothing you find at most Asian markets, but I thought it was colourful and had to buy it! I like anything bright if you hadn't already noticed".
				*choice
					#Ask: Asian markets, you travel often?
						"Yeah actually, the manager often takes us out on work holidays. He loves to travel and really reaches into the funds to take us to some bizarre places!"
						*choice
							#Ask: Where have you been so far?
								"Well so far I have been lucky enough to visit: England, Finland, France, Italy, Spain, The Netherlands, The Vatican, Turkey, Wales, Cambodia, Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, USA & Australia. All over really!"
							#Sounds like a cool place to work, perhaps I should quit my job and find one here.
								"Haha okay!" I suppose you could contact the manager, he's not hiring but I'm sure he'll appreciate you dropping by. ${contactLink}
								*choice
									#I'll do that, thanks. 
					#Say: Well I'm sure your brightness doesn't just reflect your taste in clothes...
						"Oh my. Nobody told me you were such a smooth talker!" The designer is beginning to suspect some flirting going on.
						*choice
							#Keep flirting, see where it goes.
								"Is this why you came to the office?! I am flattered but it's a little embarrassing with everyone around!"
								*choice
									#Keep flirting.
										Lucy steps in: "Okay ${name} let's move on shall we!? Let's go see the manager."
										*finish
									#Apologise and make small talk.
										"It's okay if you want we can talk more over coffee or whatever you drink?"
										*choice
											#Say: Yeah sure sounds great!
												You have acquired a date with the designer! You have a spring in your step and am ready for the your next adventure. Lucy approaches and says "The manager will see you now".
												*finish
											#Say: No thanks, apologies for coming across like that.
											The designer comes across embarrassed, turns around and gets on with work without making any eye contact. Lucy steps in, cutting the tension and says: "Excuse me, the manager will see you now".
											*finish
									#Ask the designer out on a date.
										It's gone well, the designer agrees to your date request. You feel overwhelmed that a simple office visit could result in a date. Lucy steps in and says: "Excuse me, the manager will see you now".
										*finish
							#Stop those thoughts straight away, remain professional and	talk about the weather.
								
									
					#No no, I will stick to the agency, I prefer the to know my project is going through the right channels.
						Safe choice
						*finish
			#Ask about some of the weird items on the desk
				"This is a playlist mixer. This allows me to play any song of my choice in the office. All I need to do is think of a song, enter it in this device, magic happens and it plays throughout the office."
				*choice
					#Ask: What kind of music do you like listening to?
					#Ask: Can that not get controversial, what if you
				
	#The developer
		Good choice ${name}, the developer is tough but fair. Letting you know what you can achieve within your budget. Now what do you want to make?
		*choice
			#I want you to create a social network
				There are lots of those
				*finish
			#I want to make a media sharing service
				Okay, to start you'll need a hosting service that can handle lots of disk space. Giving your users the ability to upload media of any size will also require optimising. 
				*finish
			#I want to make an app that will make me millions!
				Everyone and their dog has an app idea, what makes yours so special?
				*choice
					#My idea comes with a threat in the shape of this knife, make my millions or else!
						You've taken this too far, the police have been contacted and are on their way. It's only a matter of time now. In the meantime what do you want to do?
						*choice
							#Attempt to escape, RUN!
								Good news, you actually escaped. All those hours spent on the track during your school years served you well. But a criminal life is hard and eventually you will grow tired living life on the run. Was this really the outcome you were expecting by entering my site?
								*finish
							#Give in, apologise.
								Very good, you just about managed to pull it together before something terrible happened. You get arrested but are only given 120 hours of community service. Not bad really.
								*finish
							#Mutilate the developer, hide the body.
								Get off my site!!
								*finish
					#I've got backing. All you have to worry about is making it. Let me handle the success.
						Can't argue with that. I look forward to bringing your dream into a reality.
						*finish
	#The manager
		I'm afraid the manager is in a meeting at the moment, but he will be available shortly. In the meantime why not approach someone else.
		*goto approach
	#Sales representative
		Not afraid to sugar-coat the truth. Mostly there to keep you happy, but anything to put a smile on your face. Consider the sales representative as moral support. What do you need support with?
		*choice
			#I want support making a social network
				Go for it.
				*finish
			#I want support making a media sharing service
				Go for it.
				*finish
			#I want support making an app idea that will make me millions! 
				Got for it
